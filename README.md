# Hangman-in-react
This is the hangman game written in react using parcel instead of webpack.

Install the game with ```git clone https://github.com/sventronix/Hangman-in-react.git```. Afterwards go into the folder and run the ```npm install package.json``` comand. Than all that is left to do is to run the ```npm start``` comand.
